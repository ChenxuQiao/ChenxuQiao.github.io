The primary purpose of education is to prepare students for a career, rather than to develop well-rounded individuals. In contemporary society, the role of education is a subject of ongoing debate. While some argue that its main objective should be to equip students with employable skills for their future careers, I firmly believe that the primary purpose of education extends far beyond mere vocational preparation. Instead, it should aim to cultivate well-rounded individuals by fostering critical thinking, instilling high moral values, and promoting overall psychological well-being. Firstly, an education system that solely focuses on career preparation risks producing specialists who may lack the broader adaptability required in a rapidly changing world. While theoretical knowledge in a specific discipline is important, the ability to think independently and apply knowledge in diverse contexts is paramount. If schools merely force-feed students information or encourage rote learning, they may stifle creativity and fail to stimulate students’ thought. True education should nurture innate aptitudes and develop critical skills that allow individuals to analyze complex issues, rather than simply memorize equations, formulas, theorems, and laws. Secondly, education plays a crucial role in personal development. Its goal should be to promote the student’s physical, mental, and emotional development. Engaging in extracurricular activities, for instance, fosters team spirit and helps mould one’s character. Furthermore, a comprehensive curriculum that includes the humanities and social sciences allows students to develop a sense of responsibility towards society. This holistic approach ensures that adolescents grow into responsible citizens who can contribute to societal well-being, rather than individuals who follow things blindly. Ultimately, while preparing students for employment is an important aspect of schooling, it should not overshadow the fundamental goal of developing individuals who are intellectually curious and ethically sound. An education system that successfully motivates students to learn things through understanding and encourages them to become versatile thinkers will better serve both the individual and society. Ignoring these broader aims may create undue pressure for immediate job relevance, at the expense of long-term growth. ii. 科技与媒体 (Technology &amp; Media) 科技发展 尖端技术 (名词): cutting-edge technology 信息时代 (名词): the information age 互联网的普及 (名词短语): the proliferation of the Internet 科技创新 (名词): technological innovations/advances 提高效率 (动词): augment/enhance/boost efficiency 提高生产力 (动词): augment/enhance/boost productivity 自动化 (名词): automation 媒体传播 时事 (名词): current affairs 印刷媒体 / 电子媒体: the print media / the electronic media 新闻渠道 (名词): news outlets 无处不在的 (形容词): prevalent, ubiquitous, pervasive 充斥着…: be awash with sth., be inundated with sth. 审查 (动词): censor (vt.) 删除 (动词): delete, eliminate, excise (vt.) 过度的暴力与色情内容: excessive/gratuitous violent and pornographic content 误导性的/歪曲的 (形容词): misleading, misrepresented, distorted 欺诈性的 (形容词): fraudulent 媒体炒作 (名词): media hype 夸大事实: exaggerate things, sensationalize things 客观公正的 (形容词): objective and balanced 揭露 (动词): expose, reveal, uncover 侵犯隐私 (动词短语): violate/intrude on/infringe on someone’s privacy 损害名誉 (动词短语): tarnish/sully/smear one’s reputation 不客观的/有偏见的 (形容词): biased, skewed, unobjective 如实的报道 (名词): factual accounts 可靠的 (形容词): reliable, trustworthy 最新的 (形容词): up-to-date, up-to-the-minute 有新闻价值的 (形容词): newsworthy 道德准则 (名词): code of ethics 托福作文范文 (科技与媒体) Topic: Do you agree or disagree with the statement? The media (news organizations) are having a negative impact on society. In the information age, media have become an undeniably pervasive force, shaping public discourse thanks to the proliferation of the Internet and electronic media. While the media’s vital role in disseminating information is indisputable, I contend that certain prevalent trends within modern news outlets are exerting a detrimental impact on society, primarily stemming from the tendency to sensationalize news and the potential for biased reporting. One significant concern is the media’s tendency to exaggerate things, often driven by a pursuit of viewership. An emphasis on media hype frequently overshadows the commitment to objective and balanced reporting, consequently distorting public perception. For instance, the disproportionate focus on excessive violent content leads to a public that is inundated with fear-inducing narratives rather than factual accounts. The societal consequence is often an elevated state of anxiety and a skewed understanding of actual risks. Furthermore, the challenge of maintaining objectivity remains a critical issue. Underlying economic and political pressures can lead to skewed or unobjective reporting. Some news organizations might excise dissenting viewpoints or strategically frame information to favor a particular agenda. This makes it difficult for citizens to find consistently reliable and trustworthy sources, especially when the online sphere is awash with misleading narratives and sometimes fraudulent information. This can severely undermine the media’s crucial role as a guardian of public interest. It is, however, essential to acknowledge the positive contributions. Investigative journalism can uncover scandals, reveal systemic injustices, and provide up-to-date information on current affairs. The core problem arises not from the media itself, but from operational practices where the pressure to be entertaining or newsworthy can compromise journalistic integrity. In conclusion, while an independent media is indispensable, its current trajectory, marked by sensationalism and bias, is a cause for concern. To mitigate these negative impacts, consumers must cultivate critical discernment, and news organizations must recommit to their foundational code of ethics, prioritizing truth over media hype. iii. 旅游 (Tourism) 旅游景点 (名词): tourist attraction, place of interest 开阔眼界 (动词短语): broaden one’s horizons, expand one’s vision 与当地人互动: interact with the locals/local inhabitants 促进文化交流: promote cultural communication/exchange 亲身体验 (名词): first-hand experience 冲突 (名词): conflict 将游客与当地人隔离开 (动词): seclude/isolate tourists from the locals 商业化 (动词): commercialize, commodify 专骗游客的劣质商品或服务 (名词): tourist traps 间接体验 (名词): second-hand experience, vicarious experience 文化遗产 (名词): cultural heritage 互联网不会让旅游业过时: The Internet will not render tourism obsolete. 托福作文范文 (旅游) Topic: Some people say that tourism helps to promote understanding between countries. Others say that tourism causes tension between people from different cultures. What is your opinion? The global tourism industry has brought diverse cultures into closer contact, sparking debate about its societal impact. While critics contend it can lead to conflict, I believe the benefits of tourism in bridging cultural divides often outweigh the negatives, especially when managed responsibly. On one hand, tourism offers invaluable opportunities to gain first-hand experience of different ways of life, which can effectively broaden one’s horizons. When tourists respectfully interact with the locals, they move beyond stereotypes, leading to a more authentic appreciation of other cultures. Such meaningful interactions can build genuine empathy in a way that no second-hand experience from documentaries can. This demonstrates that even in a digital age, the Internet will not render tourism obsolete in its capacity for human connection. On the other hand, it is undeniable that unchecked tourism can be a source of tension. An influx of visitors can strain local resources and damage fragile ecosystems. Furthermore, tourism can lead to the commercialization or even commodification of cultural heritage, causing resentment among local inhabitants. Certain resorts might seclude tourists from the locals, creating socio-economic enclaves that prevent meaningful interaction. The proliferation of exploitative tourist traps can further detract from an authentic visitor experience. However, these negative consequences are typically symptomatic of unsustainable practices. Responsible tourism initiatives—which prioritize respect for local culture, ensure equitable economic benefits, and encourage genuine interaction—can effectively mitigate these issues. When host communities are empowered in the planning and management of tourism, the likelihood of conflict significantly diminishes. In conclusion, while tourism carries the potential for cultural friction, its capacity to foster understanding and break down international barriers is immense. By emphasizing respectful and sustainable engagement, tourism can serve as a significant positive force, allowing people to expand their vision and appreciation of our shared global community. iv. 政府 (Government) 当局 (名词): authorities 公民/全体公民 (名词): citizens, the citizenry 规范/管理 (动词): regulate, administer, oversee 实施 (动词): implement 立法 (动词): legislate 严禁 (动词短语): strictly prohibit, ban altogether 严格的法律 (名词): stringent laws 监督/审查 (名词/动词): scrutiny (n.), scrutinize (vt.) 为…拨款/资助 (动词短语): allocate money to sth., subsidize, invest in sth., fund 预算 (名词): budget 税收 (名词): tax revenue 政府开支 (名词): government spending/expenditure on sth. 削减 (动词): curtail 当务之急/优先事项 (名词): priority 把…当作当务之急: give priority to sth. 责任/义务 (名词): obligation, responsibility 国家安全 (名词): national security 缺乏远见的政策 (名词): short-sighted policy 恶性循环 (名词): a vicious circle 失业 (名词): unemployment, joblessness 基础设施 (名词): infrastructure (e.g., public transport, power grid) 民主和开明的政府: a democratic and progressive government 托福作文范文 (政府) Topic: It is more important for a government to spend money on improving infrastructure than on funding the arts. Do you agree or disagree? The allocation of public funds is a perennial subject of debate. While both infrastructure development and arts funding contribute to the well-being of the citizenry, I largely agree that government spending on improving infrastructure should take precedence. This is because robust infrastructure forms the bedrock of economic vitality and public safety, which are fundamental responsibilities of any government. Firstly, a well-maintained infrastructure is essential for a society’s daily functioning and economic prosperity. When authorities allocate money to these areas, they directly boost productivity and improve the quality of life for all citizens. Neglecting infrastructure can lead to economic stagnation and a lower standard of living. Therefore, governments must give priority to these foundational investments. Secondly, while the arts enrich society, their funding can often be supported by private patronage and corporate sponsorships. The government’s primary obligation is to provide essential public services that the private sector is less likely to address, such as ensuring national security or supporting the unemployed. If a government is forced to curtail its budget, cutting back on arts subsidies is often less detrimental in the short term than underfunding critical infrastructure projects. Of course, this does not mean the arts should be entirely neglected. A democratic and progressive government should strive to foster a culturally vibrant society. However, the scale of investment needs to be proportional to other pressing needs. A short-sighted policy would be to lavishly fund artistic endeavors while bridges crumble. The most prudent approach involves finding a balance, but when faced with limited resources derived from tax revenue, fundamental needs related to infrastructure must be the priority. In conclusion, while both are valuable, the government’s core responsibility to ensure the economic well-being of its people makes spending on infrastructure a more critical priority. Strategic investment in these foundational elements creates a stable platform upon which other societal benefits, including a flourishing arts scene, can be built. v. 动物 (Animals) 动物权益保护主义者 (名词): animal rights activists 医学研究 (名词): medical research 残忍的 (形容词): cruel, merciless, inhuman 活体解剖 (名词): vivisection 麻醉剂 (名词): anesthetic 减轻动物痛苦 (动词短语): alleviate/ease animals’ pain 宠物是主人的伙伴: Pets are companions of their masters. 偷猎 (名词): poaching 没有替代品: There are no replacements/substitutes/alternatives for sth. 栖息地 (名词): habitat 濒危物种 (名词): endangered species 不人道的 (形容词): inhumane 托福作文范文 (动物) Topic: Some people think that the use of animals for medical experimentation is cruel. Others believe it is essential. Discuss both views and give your opinion. The ethics of using animals in medical research is a deeply divisive issue. While some view the practice as inherently cruel, others argue it is vital for scientific progress. Proponents of discontinuing animal experimentation, often including animal rights activists, highlight the suffering inflicted upon animals. They argue that procedures like vivisection are inhuman and inhumane. They question the translatability of findings from animals to humans, suggesting resources would be better invested in developing alternative research methods. Conversely, many scientists maintain that animal research is indispensable. They contend that for many complex biological systems, there are no substitutes for live animal models. Historically, numerous medical breakthroughs have relied on animal experimentation. Supporters emphasize regulations in place to minimize suffering, such as the mandatory use of anesthetics and efforts to ease animals’ pain. In my opinion, while the immediate abolition of animal testing might hinder critical medical research, society has an ethical obligation to vigorously pursue alternatives. The goal should be the eventual replacement of animal models wherever feasible. Until then, the use of animals must be strictly regulated, limited to essential research where no viable alternatives exist, and conducted with the utmost effort to alleviate animals’ pain. We must protect all living beings, especially endangered species whose habitats are already under threat from activities like poaching. vi. 语言与文化 (Language &amp; Culture) 通用语 (名词): a lingua franca, a universal language 英语的普及 (名词): the proliferation of English 英语的主导地位 (名词): the dominant role of English 方言/本地语言 (名词): dialect, vernacular, the indigenous language 小语种将消亡: Lesser-known languages will become extinct/obsolete. 小语种的消亡 (名词): the extinction/demise of lesser-known languages 文化遗产 (名词): cultural heritage 祖先 (名词): forefathers, ancestors 后代 (名词): descendants, posterity 少数民族 (名词): ethnic minorities 民族和谐 (名词): harmony between ethnic groups 文化融合 (名词): cultural integration and synthesis 相互影响 (名词): interaction 文化多元性 (名词): cultural diversity 丰富 (动词): enrich (vt.) 狭隘的观念 (名词): insular/provincial mentality 贬低/轻视 (动词): deprecate, denigrate, disparage (文化)特性 (名词): (cultural) identity 历史悠久的 (形容词): time-honored 托福作文范文 (语言与文化) Topic: The globalization of business means all countries should adopt English as their primary language for education and commerce. Do you agree or disagree? The rise of globalization has fostered interconnectedness, with English often serving as a lingua franca. This has led some to argue that all nations should adopt it as their primary language. However, I disagree, as this would lead to the extinction of lesser-known languages, erode cultural diversity, and impoverish our collective human cultural heritage. Firstly, mandating English would inevitably disparage indigenous languages and local dialects. Language is intrinsically linked to cultural identity, carrying the history and values of its speakers, passed down from their ancestors. If lesser-known languages become extinct, a wealth of knowledge is lost forever, impacting not only direct descendants but all of posterity. Secondly, the widespread adoption of English could undermine harmony between ethnic groups. For ethnic minorities, their vernacular is a cornerstone of their community. Forcing them to abandon their mother tongue could lead to alienation rather than promoting healthy cultural integration and synthesis. True progress lies in multilingualism, which enriches societies. While the proliferation of English offers benefits, it does not require abandoning other languages. Many countries successfully navigate globalization while preserving their own languages, often by promoting bilingualism. This allows citizens to participate in the global sphere while maintaining their distinct cultural identity and time-honored traditions. Culture is not static, and embracing global communication does not necessitate the deprecation of local languages. In conclusion, while English plays an important role as a universal language, its adoption as the primary language for all would be detrimental to global cultural diversity. Fostering an environment where multiple cultures can have positive interaction is a far more enriching path. vii. 发展 (Development) 社会与生活节奏 生活节奏加速: The tempo/pace of life has accelerated. 疲劳 (名词): fatigue 导致人与人之间的疏远: create alienation between people 过于功利的/拜金的 (形容词): materialistic, money-worshipping 追求最大利润: pursue maximum profit 现状 (名词): the status quo 城市化与交通 交通堵塞 (名词): traffic congestion, gridlock 阻碍 (动词): impede, hinder, hamper 有历史意义的建筑: buildings of historic significance 拆除建筑物 (动词短语): tear down/demolish/raze a building 高楼大厦 (名词): high-rise buildings, skyscrapers 城市化 (名词): urbanization 城乡差距 (名词): the disparity between the city and the countryside 设施 (名词): facilities 次等的/较差的 (形容词): inferior 工作与休闲 在家办公/远程办公 (动词): telecommute 休闲 (名词): leisure, recreation 起反作用的 (形容词): counterproductive 劳动力资源 (名词): labor pool 抑郁症 (名词): depression 失眠 (名词): insomnia 社会问题 扶贫 (名词): poverty alleviation 就业机会 (名词): employment opportunity 贫穷的 (形容词): needy, poverty-stricken, impoverished 富裕的 (形容词): affluent, wealthy 人口爆炸 (名词): population explosion 缺少运动的生活方式 (名词): sedentary lifestyle 托福作文范文 (发展) Topic: The rapid pace of modern life and increasing urbanization are largely negative developments for individuals and society. To what extent do you agree or disagree? In recent decades, the tempo of life has accelerated, particularly within expanding urban centers. While this era of intense urbanization has yielded benefits, I largely agree that its overall impact has been predominantly negative, leading to increased stress and alienation between people. One of the most significant drawbacks is the impact on individual well-being. The relentless pressure to succeed in a materialistic society, coupled with navigating traffic congestion, contributes to chronic fatigue and stress. This environment can impede personal growth and lead to health issues like depression and insomnia. Many individuals find little time for leisure, and this constant pressure can be counterproductive. Furthermore, rapid urbanization can exacerbate social inequalities and strain public facilities. As cities grow, the disparity between the city and the countryside may widen. This can lead to overcrowded living conditions and inferior public services for poverty-stricken populations living alongside affluent ones. The focus on constructing new skyscrapers sometimes comes at the expense of preserving buildings of historic significance. Of course, urbanization drives economic growth, offering access to a diverse labor pool and fostering innovation. However, this pursuit should not overshadow the need for a healthy social fabric. While options to telecommute might help, the underlying status quo often prioritizes relentless development over human well-being. A broader strategy must address issues like poverty alleviation and mental health. In conclusion, while modern development offers advantages, its current trajectory presents significant negative consequences. A shift towards more human-centered development is needed to ensure progress truly serves the well-being of all citizens, rather than just the goal to pursue maximum profit. viii. 环境 (Environment) 生态平衡 (名词): ecological balance/equilibrium 可持续发展 (名词): sustainable development 环保主义者 (名词): environmentalists, conservationists 环保的 (形容词): environmentally friendly, eco-friendly 节约使用 (动词): conserve (e.g., water/energy) 保护 (动词): preserve (e.g., natural resources) 回收 (动词): recycle 各国必须联手解决环境问题: Countries must join forces/make a concerted effort to combat/tackle environmental problems. 增强公众意识: raise public awareness of sth. 短缺 (名词): shortage, scarcity 破坏自然资源: wreak havoc on natural resources 砍伐森林 (名词): deforestation 污染 (动词): pollute, contaminate 有毒的 (形容词): poisonous, toxic 可再生资源 (名词): renewable resources (e.g., solar energy) 不可再生资源 (名词): non-renewable resources (e.g., fossil fuels) 消耗 (资源) (动词): consume, deplete 用尽 (资源) (动词短语): use up, exhaust 生态系统 (名词): ecosystem 生物多样性 (名词): biodiversity 排放 (污染物) (动词): discharge 温室效应/全球变暖 (名词): greenhouse effect, global warming 白色污染 (名词): non-biodegradable garbage 谴责而非纵容: condemn rather than condone sth. 臭氧层 (名词): ozone layer 耕地 (名词): arable land 开采自然资源 (动词短语): exploit natural resources (情况)恶化 (动词): deteriorate, aggravate 托福作文范文 (环境) Topic: Some believe economic development is too important to be hindered by environmental concerns. Others argue environmental protection must be prioritized. Discuss both views. The relationship between economic development and environmental protection is a critical debate. While both perspectives have merit, I believe that environmental protection must be integrated into, and considered a prerequisite for, true sustainable development. Proponents of prioritizing economic development argue that it is necessary to improve living standards. From this viewpoint, environmental regulations can be seen as burdens. This perspective can lead to the over-exploitation of natural resources and practices that pollute air and water, assuming damage can be fixed later. However, this ignores that non-renewable resources are finite and damage can deteriorate to an irreversible state. Conversely, environmentalists argue that the environment is the foundation upon which economies are built. Activities like deforestation, the discharge of toxic waste, and burning fossil fuels not only wreak havoc on natural resources and biodiversity but also undermine long-term economic stability. Global warming, driven by the greenhouse effect, poses a grave threat to agriculture and infrastructure. Failing to preserve the environment is economically irrational. In my opinion, the idea that these two are mutually exclusive is a false dichotomy. True progress lies in pursuing sustainable development, which involves investing in renewable resources and promoting eco-friendly technologies. We must condemn rather than condone practices that damage the ecosystem. Raising public awareness is also crucial. Economic development that depletes resources and contaminates the environment is not development but a temporary gain that will aggravate problems in the long run. ix. 全球化 (Globalization) 文化特性 (名词): (national/regional) cultural identity 全球文化同质化 (名词): global cultural homogenization 文化同一性 (名词): cultural homogeneity/uniformity 全球化是一把双刃剑: Globalization is a double-edged sword. 地球村 (名词): the global village 席卷一切的趋势 (名词): sweeping trends 融合东西方文化: synthesize Asian and Western cultures 侵蚀/削弱 (动词): erode 普遍的 (形容词): universal 托福作文范文 (全球化) Topic: Do you agree or disagree? Globalization is primarily a negative force concerning its impact on cultural identity. Globalization, one of the most sweeping trends of our time, has transformed the world into a global village. While it presents challenges, I believe globalization is a double-edged sword and not a primarily negative force. One primary concern is that globalization leads to global cultural homogenization. The argument is that dominant Western media and corporations can erode local cultures, resulting in cultural uniformity where unique customs are replaced by a universal consumer culture. This suggests a loss of distinct cultural identity. However, this view oversimplifies cultural exchange. Globalization also provides opportunities for cultures to share their unique attributes with a wider audience. The internet allows for the preservation and promotion of minority languages and traditions. Furthermore, many cultures actively synthesize global influences with their own, creating new, vibrant forms of expression. This suggests globalization can also be a catalyst for cultural innovation. Increased interaction can also lead to greater understanding and tolerance. While the risk of cultural erosion is real, active engagement with global trends can strengthen, rather than diminish, a sense of local pride and cultural identity, as communities make conscious choices about what to adopt, adapt, or preserve. In conclusion, while fears of global cultural homogenization are valid, globalization itself is not inherently negative. The ultimate impact depends on the agency of local communities to engage critically with global influences, preserving their heritage while embracing innovation. x. 家庭 (Family) 老年人 (名词): elderly people, senior citizens 家庭成员间的情感纽带 (名词): family bonds, family ties 归属感 (名词): a sense of belonging 对…的依恋 (名词): an attachment to sth. 贫困家庭 (名词): deprived/impoverished families 富裕家庭 (名词): affluent families 单亲家庭 (名词): single-parent household 虐待 (动词/名词): mistreat, abuse 家庭暴力 (名词): domestic violence 毒品上瘾: addiction to drugs 性别平等 (名词): gender equality 歧视 (名词): discrimination 开明的社会 (名词): an enlightened society 家务 (名词): household chores 被…束缚/拖累: be tied down by sth. 子女/后代 (名词): offspring 性格冲突 (名词): personality clashes 代沟 (名词): generation gap 和谐 (名词): harmony 托福作文范文 (家庭) Topic: Discuss the challenges to maintaining strong family relationships in modern life and suggest ways to overcome them. The family unit, a source of individual sense of belonging, faces complex pressures in the modern era. While the ideal of strong family bonds remains cherished, contemporary lifestyles challenge these connections. Understanding these hurdles is the first step towards fostering resilient families within an enlightened society. One challenge is economic demand. In both affluent and deprived families, the necessity of dual incomes often means parents work long hours, reducing quality interaction with their offspring. Parents can feel tied down by responsibilities, and financial stress can lead to personality clashes. Another challenge is the widening generation gap, amplified by technology. Elderly people may find it difficult to relate to the digital experiences of younger family members. Differing perspectives on issues like gender equality regarding the distribution of household chores can cause friction. To overcome these challenges, families must make conscious efforts. Prioritizing quality time, free from digital distractions, is crucial. Addressing the generation gap requires mutual respect and a willingness to listen. In serious cases like domestic violence or addiction to drugs, seeking professional help is vital.

Others think there are better alternatives. Discuss both views. Reducing the crime rate is a persistent societal concern. While one solution is longer prison sentences, others argue that alternative approaches are more effective. Proponents of longer sentences argue that such stringent punishment acts as a deterrent. The fear of lengthy incarceration might make individuals hesitate before they violate the law. This approach ensures public safety by keeping those who commit a crime off the streets, which is especially important when crime is rampant. However, others contend this is a limited approach. They argue that prisons can be “schools of crime” and that long sentences do not address the root causes of crime, such as poverty or lack of education. Alternative strategies focus on prevention and rehabilitation. These methods seek to address the underlying factors that lead individuals to commit offenses, thereby reducing the incidence of crime more sustainably. In my opinion, while stringent laws and appropriate punishment are necessary, an over-reliance on longer sentences is not the most effective strategy. A more holistic approach that balances punishment with robust preventative and rehabilitative measures is likely to yield better results. Investing in social programs and rehabilitating offenders can significantly curb crime in the long term by addressing its multifaceted causes. xii. 同义词替换参考 (Synonym Replacement Guide) 人类: the human

问：你觉得哪段时期的同伴关系对你来说影响最大？ 答：我倾向于将“同伴”归为缺乏更深层次联结的同学关系，并姑且将时期划分为：小学、初中、高中、大学。 正面来讲，我认为大学期间的同学关系对我影响最大。这个时期的关系尽管普遍浅显，但非常广泛。大学前两年我较为孤僻，几乎不存在社交关系。大三下学期，我借助自媒体账号与线下志愿活动找到了许多有共同目标和爱好、十分优秀的同学。虽然大部分都仅仅见过几次面，但还是遇见了欣赏自己的人，甚至被推荐接到了人生第一个商单，对此我是十分开心的。这个时期，我虽然缺乏深层次的关系，但在经历了很多不好的事情后，也逐渐对此缺乏感知了。尽管如此，我还是认为更深的关系应当是自然的、真挚的、相互的，如果没有也是正常的。 回首过去，很大的一个错误就是沉迷在“做题蛆”的身份里，不关注任何其他方面，从而忽视了健康、社交与情商，这些都需要靠大学期间来弥补修复。 负面而言，小学是最让我深恶痛绝的时光。大部分小学时期，我都居住在铁皮加盖的厂房里，几乎没有同龄人，当时我甚至不知道“小区”是什么东西，也从来没有和同学主动在校外见过面，所以社交都局限于上学期间。小学生的“恶”也是毫无保留的……（当时受平台 500 字限制，未能展开）。 问：感觉你出国交换前后变化蛮大的，或者说这一段时期的你和大一大二时期的你有些差别，整个人更明朗了，活跃了，行动力更强了，也感觉更热爱生活了，不知道对不对，你有感受到自己的变化吗，很好奇是哪些因素改变了你会给了你哪些思考。 答：好问题！ 你的判断没错，我自己也有同感。 关于改变的因素和思考： 因素一：美国社会的开放与个人性格的磨合。 其实我本人从小到大没什么朋友，性格也比较内向。但我不是孤僻，还是很想要社交的。然而，刚进入一个开放的环境时，我非常不适应，不太敢和人搭话。但是，当地(正常)民众确实很友善，会主动发起 small talk，甚至任何地方买单都会问 “How are you?”，这也构成了我初期大部分的对话。慢慢地，我发现自己逐渐适应了这种氛围，每次和别人搭话都不会像之前那样胆怯了。如果不是口语比较差的话，我想我会表现得更好。 因素二：更多的阅历丰富了我的人生观。 一开始我认为“努力 == 做题 == 学习 == 成功”，而我逐渐认识到，成功总是离不开各种各样的条件：强健的体魄、广泛的社交、求索的欲望… 于是我便摒弃原先的想法，从最开始的排斥社交，到逐渐享受认识更多人的过程。这些目的虽然最初有些功利心，但是后来也确实是乐在其中。这里所说的成功就是财富自由，从小的社交缺乏导致了我有些自卑，虽然不免有些俗气，但追求这种朴素的目标确实能弥补我过往的创伤，至少让我认为自己确实在努力。 问：准备保研考研秋招还是别的方向呀 答：大一的时候就没考虑过在国内读研。一方面，国内基本都是两三年的硕士，时间太长了，我还是想早点工作；另一方面，我想读个理工科或是和数据相关的硕士，本科专业对我而言没有太大用处，而国内读研很难转专业。 所以还是想出国读个硕士吧 🥹 我觉得我还是需要一个海外文凭来充实一下自己。 问：哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈哈 答：哈哈哈哈哈(｡ì _ í｡)
